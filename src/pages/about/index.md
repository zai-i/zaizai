title: About Me
---
As an 8 year old in the 90s, I used to love inhabiting the virtual realms of neopets, inspiring my lifelong journey of learning to code. My current position is as a front-end engineer at Wonderbly, a publisher that produces personalised books using technology. \
\
I’ve always appreciated self-expression and creativity, which is why front-end development appeals to me. In my free time, I also like writing poetry and reading, fashion, learning languages and exploring London.
