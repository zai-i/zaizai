As an 8-year-old in the 90s, I loved to inhabit the virtual world of neopets, inspiring my lifelong journey of learning to code from a young age. I vividly remember the joys and frustrations I experienced on my learning curve, the euphoric eureka moments as I developed my skills. My favourite memory being,Â wow, I can actually do this thing called copy-and-paste instead of typing every single line of code(!)\
\
I love self-expression and creativity, which draws me to front-end development. In my free time, I like writing and reading poetry, short stories and plays, fashion, learning languages and exploring London. I studied English Literature with Creative Writing at uni.\

Currently, I work at Wonderbly as a front-end engineer, a publisher that produces personalised books using technology.
