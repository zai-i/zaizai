Light and shade, colours overlapping until the end of time when the train might decide to blur in and out. 



Maybe our eyes are made for this express purpose, to quantify each passing cloud, focused on its geometric beauty.



Maybe each leaf that beseeches the London sky has sworn to dance in the drizzle, the golden ratio an abstract anthem tracing around its form. And maybe I should dissect summer’s colours slowly under my thumb rather than stay comfortably numb, texting you in a fit of repeating rain.



Sunset collapses in on itself. I yawn at your reply.



The lamps paint lemon parallelograms on the platform, sketch some kind of sanctuary for me in the dark.
