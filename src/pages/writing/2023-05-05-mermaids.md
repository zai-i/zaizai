In summer, we dredged the oxbow lake for dancers. \
\
We came to the lake’s edge. We saw ballerina pumps with tourmaline-tipped bows and fuchsia fabric diffusing in a hush of amnesia. Their long arms reached for sunshine like studded branches as they beseeched water.  Their palms cupped the space, fragile verdigris vessels feeling precious treasures floating faintly around them.\
\
What did they pray for? Maybe for lush land, the solidity of our structures swelling up over their little blue horseshoe. So, we dredged the lake for dancers and they were dragged straight out. The very last things to emerge were ponderous teal tails, fused to their budding waists like forked florets and scored with little blistered scales. \
\
When they became upended, all their tails slumped on the hills — dimpled with stars like the plump rainbows of oil-spills, warped, obsidian.
