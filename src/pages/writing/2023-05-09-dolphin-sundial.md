Tall metal sundial\
phantoms falling for aeons\
the statue ticks on\
\
A golden ghost dives\
blocked by the bronze curvature\
to snatch a moment\
\
Fleeting to the next\
in the meeting-spot of tails\
a dot drills the scale\
\
I look at my phone\
overturning the noon sun\
sad obsolescence\
\
Helvetica text\
nurses the meridian\
on a number-line\
\
Made turquoise by time\
dolphins did not foreshadow\
this future rippling\
\
This hidden system\
that disciplines the digits\
it capsizes stars
