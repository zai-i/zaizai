I catch a song of retrospect, \
studded with notes like talons flat and sharp \
until my feathers fall apart. \
\
Lips hate, howl and eye the past,\
petrol on the grass. How fault-lines crush, \
throwing up ancient land, lush \
and too dark, destroying and creating,\
brand-new vitriol bruising\
oriole wings against the brain. 

I catch train after train.\
Billboards twist neon nests in the city,\
doe-eyed light maternal and warm around me.\
I catch my mind twisting backwards over\
the years and white noise blackens, \
taking back my time in the crush of tectonic plates\
until I catch birdsong under the stars.
