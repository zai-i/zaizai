The rain reminds me of my roots on Earth.\
A holy hush settles absolute on Earth.

Clouds heave in their heavenly bellies\
mute rain destined to shoot on Earth.

Clouds come undone with petrichor\
and nourish the thirsty fruit on Earth.

A floral fog births echoing promises. \
The echoing promises run loose on Earth. 

A round cradle sustains me. The rain reins me \
back to this perfect truth on Earth.
