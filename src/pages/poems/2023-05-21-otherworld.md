I tried to un-ghost the wilting tongue,\
the half-lit voice of my elders, vying for fluorescence.\
It blossomed elsewhere but I was young.

Lotuses of language floated along\
communities too alien to me. In my defence,\
I tried to un-ghost the wilting tongue,

attentive when we’d visit. It sizzled among\
anecdotes, an untranslated loop when\
it blossomed elsewhere and I was young.

I struggled to untangle songs\
like polyglot knots and notes on conjugating tenses.\
I tried to un-ghost the wilting tongue,

curving my mouth to nurse the syllables all wrong,\
the verses rising and falling into obsolescence.\
It blossomed elsewhere but I was young.

Gone is the guttural obstacle between loved ones\
and the nostalgia I’ll never hear again.\
I was too late to un-ghost the wilting tongue.\
It blossomed elsewhere. I was young.
