Lockdown is darkening but I feel like dancing.\
I teach my hands cat-like reflexes, dancing,

each clockwise and anti-clockwise motion.\
Blue hues twist against red, double helix dancing.

The disco squares on my palms pirouette,\
following algorithms of rhythmic dancing.

My brain and my cube are devoted to \
arcane secrets from Youtube, Rubik’s dancing.

As the clock-hands tick, second-hand knowledge\
fills up the evenings, Zai—quick flicks, dancing.
