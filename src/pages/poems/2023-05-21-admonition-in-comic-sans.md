Once I penned an ode for you \
it filled my gaps and overlapped hollow divergent streets

Then I tore you out \
akin to scar tissue on my left arm \
\[couldn’t extinguish the oven tray] 

Now I write limericks about how you’re a fool \
your name \
either birdsong or a riddle scorched on skin \
I can’t distinguish
