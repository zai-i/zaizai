I acquire a little comfort from a pipette.\
Kitchen sink, your shiny buttercup offsets me as\
the darkness of my mind sips it.

My larynx will be choral with rosettes.\
Press the indigo bulb; wasps whistle off the vase.\
I acquire a little comfort from a pipette.

Their jejune magenta tongues tell me to quit it.\
My floral language praises its force in case\
the darkness of my mind strips it.

Love dovetails with my tastebuds. Transparent\
5 millilitres of the elixir say,\
“Acquire a little comfort from a pipette.”

The dew runs clear as a phantom’s silhouette.\
A stigma put this flower in disgrace.\
The darkness of my mind snips it.

I’ll harvest all the sweetness I can get\
from a sour taste which (seldom) irritates.\
I acquire a little comfort from a pipette.\
The darkness of my mind sips it.
