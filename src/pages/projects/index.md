Lately I’ve been seeking ways to explore all the things I love within little online spaces. I’ve developed a React app I’ve called [Hummingbird](http://hummingbird.zaiz.ai). Fascinated by how randomness and fridge magnet poetry can drive inspiration, I wanted to see what is creatively possible with this concept, done digitally.

For Arabic learning, I have created [a reference tool for Tajweed](http://tajweed.zaiz.ai) (correct pronunciation of the Arabic alphabet) and [Alifba](http://alifba.zaiz.ai), a drag-and-drop educational game for children.

My curiosity about ChatGPT has also led me to create [Emoji575](http://emoji575.zaiz.ai), which can transform a user’s selection of emojis into a haiku.
