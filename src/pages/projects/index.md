I’ve always been seeking ways to explore all the things I love within little online spaces. I’ve developed a React app I’ve called [Hummingbird](https://www.hummingbird.zaiz.ai). Fascinated by how randomness and fridge magnet poetry can drive inspiration, I wanted to see what is creatively possible with this concept, done digitally.

My curiosity about ChatGPT has also led me to create [Emoji575](https://www.emoji575.zaiz.ai), which can transform a chosen combination of emojis into a haiku. Although my ChatGPT subscription has recently terminated, the interface is still available to view.

[Lyriki](http://lyriki.zaiz.ai) is another text generation experiment which hopes to find serendipitous rhyming couplets made from Wikipedia articles and famous sonnets. 

For Arabic learning, I have created [a reference tool for Tajweed](https://www.tajweed.zaiz.ai) (correct pronunciation of the Arabic alphabet) and [Alifba](http://alifba.zaiz.ai), a drag-and-drop educational game for children.

My [Codepen account](https://codepen.io/zai24) exhibits some assorted experiments.

I’ve also made a Twitter bot (now inactive) named [Idyllic Rain](https://botwiki.org/bot/idyllicrain/) that randomly generates aesthetically pleasing scenes of rainy skies and trees, produced in Canvas.

As you can hopefully tell, I’m incredibly inspired by design and the potential to bring true beauty into existence when programming.
