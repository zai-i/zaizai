I’ve always been seeking ways to explore all the things I love within little online spaces. I’ve developed a React app I’ve called [Hummingbird](https://www.hummingbird.suddenghazals.com). Fascinated by how randomness and fridge magnet poetry can drive inspiration, I wanted to see what is creatively possible with this concept, done digitally.

[Emoji575](https://www.emoji575.suddenghazals.com) is also a fun experiment which generates a haiku based on a chosen combination of emojis. A small project known as [Process](https://www.process.suddenghazals.com) is designed to help as a writing tool.

For Arabic learning, I have created [a reference tool for Tajweed](https://www.tajweed.suddenghazals.com) (correct pronunciation of the Arabic alphabet) and [Alifba](http://alifba.suddenghazals.com), a drag-and-drop educational tool.
