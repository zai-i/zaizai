I’ve always been seeking ways to explore all the things I love within little online spaces. I’ve developed a React app I’ve called [Hummingbird](https://www.hummingbird.ghazala.cc). Fascinated by how randomness and fridge magnet poetry can drive inspiration, I wanted to see what is creatively possible with this concept, done digitally.

For Arabic learning, I have created [a reference tool for Tajweed](https://www.tajweed.zaiz.ai) (correct pronunciation of the Arabic alphabet) and [Alifba](http://alifba.ghazala.cc), a drag-and-drop educational tool.

As you can hopefully tell, I’m incredibly inspired by design and the potential to bring true beauty into existence when programming, taking into account all my passions.
