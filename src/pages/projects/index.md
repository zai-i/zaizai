I’ve always been seeking ways to explore all the things I love within little online spaces. I’ve developed a React app I’ve called [Hummingbird](https://www.hummingbird.ghazala.cc). Fascinated by how randomness and fridge magnet poetry can drive inspiration, I wanted to see what is creatively possible with this concept, done digitally.

My curiosity about ChatGPT has also led me to create [Emoji575](https://www.emoji575.ghazala.cc), which can transform a chosen combination of emojis into a haiku.

[Lyriki](http://lyriki.ghazala.cc) hopes to find serendipitous rhyming couplets made from Wikipedia articles and famous sonnets. 

For Arabic learning, I have created [a reference tool for Tajweed](https://www.tajweed.zaiz.ai) (correct pronunciation of the Arabic alphabet) and [Alifba](http://alifba.ghazala.cc), a drag-and-drop educational game.

My [Codepen account](https://codepen.io/zai24) exhibits some assorted experiments.

As you can hopefully tell, I’m incredibly inspired by design and the potential to bring true beauty into existence when programming, taking into account responsive design, accessibility and all my passions.
